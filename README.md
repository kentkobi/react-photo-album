This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn start`

## Notes
- fetching from the external api could use a proxy server and I haven't secured the credentials
- opted to not use anything third-party to handle layout and presentation, was a pretty small effort to style without
- no error handling
- no testing
- used react hooks
- styling organisation is a bit threw together and should be better organised
